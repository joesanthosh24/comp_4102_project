Summary: Our project is a program that differentiates between different objects, such as people, cars, etc. Our program further counts the number of entities for each object. This is to make sure there is a safe amount of certain objects in a specific location.

Background: There has been work done in the past on object detection, our project further builds on it by specifying the quantity of each object which can be used for numerous application (e.g. checking full capacity in a room or elevator). 

The Challenge: When trying to detect a person, there are many variables in play like people have different types of hair, different sizes, etc. The environment plays a big role because if they are inside then the visibility is lot more clearer than if they were outside and if part of their body is behind a different object, it can be harder to tell.

Goals and Deliverables: We want to be able to distinguish between obvious objects (cars, people, etc.). We want to count the number of entities for a specific object we want to identify. An extra goal that we hope to achieve is to identify different entities of the same object (identify one human from another one for example).

We’ll be validating our app by providing images where you can clearly identify different objects and how many of each objects are in the image and compare it to the information that our program provides us with. For example, if we see that there are 10 humans in the image but the program identifies 9 people then we know that our program is inaccurate.

We believe that this project is achievable within the few weeks that we have, as long as we’re able to manage our time and maintain our work ethic along with good communication between the members in our team.
